Ax = B

So x = A^-1 B

We look at equations of the type
ay'' + by' + cy = erxG(x)

Where G(x) is a polynomial, a,b,c,r are constants.

Examples:
y'' -5y' + 6y = e-4x

y'' -5y' + 6y = e-3x (uh oh)

So we try y=ue-3x,  y' = u'e-3x-3ue-3x, y'' = u''e-3x-6u'e-3x+9ue-3x


Carry it forward, will get a 2nd order constant coeff eqn.  Simple to do. Remember you just found u, not y.


y'' -5y' + 6y = e-4x(2+3x+4x2)


You Try

y'' -y' - 12y = e-3x(x+x2)
