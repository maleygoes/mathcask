## Example of distributing when there's an exponent involved

So let's say you have $(x+3)^2$ and you're asked to 'expand' or 'distribute' and combine like terms.

First we have to remember that $(x+3)^2 = (x+3)(x+3)$.  All exponents mean are "repeated multiplication."

From here, then we follow the 'double distribution'.

$$(x+3)(x+3)$$
$$ = (x)(x+3) + (3)(x+3)$$
$$ = x^2 +3x + 3x + 9$$
$$ = x^2 + 6x + 9$$

And there we have it.

The only things that would be different are the numbers inside the parentheses, and to be mindful of their sign (positive or negative) when carrying out the operations.
