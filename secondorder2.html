## First we recall Euler's formula and why we care

If we are given $e^{ib} = \cos(b) + i \sin(b)$, then we can see for any complex number $z = a+ib$:

$$e^{a+ib} = e^a \cdot e^{ib} = e^a(\cos(b) + i \sin(b))$$

And so:

$$e^{(a \pm ib)t} = e^{at} \cdot e^{\pm ibt} = e^{at}(\cos(bt) \pm i \sin(bt))$$

This forms the basis of solutions in the complex numbers.  If we just take 

$$x_1 = e^{at}(\cos(bt) + i \sin(bt))$$

and 

$$x_2 = e^{at}(\cos(bt) - i \sin(bt))$$

Then we take a linear combination of them:  $x'_1 = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}$ and $x'_2 = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{2i}$ we get $\{ x'_1, x'_2 \}$ as general real valued solutions.

### Example

Find the general solution to: $y'' + 2y' + 5y = 0$


## 5.3 Nonhomogeneous Linear Equations

We now consider the **nonhomogeneous linear second-order ODE**
[
a_2(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = g(x),
]
where (g(x)) (the **forcing function**) is not identically zero.

---

### 1. Existence and Uniqueness (Theorem 5.3.1)

If (a_2, a_1, a_0,) and (g) are **continuous** on an open interval (I), and (a_2(x)\neq0) on (I),
then for any initial conditions (y(x_0)=y_0,; y'(x_0)=y_1),
the IVP has a **unique solution** on (I).

---

### 2. Complementary and Particular Solutions

* The **associated homogeneous (complementary) equation**:
  [
  a_2y'' + a_1y' + a_0y = 0.
  ]
* Its general solution (y_c = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2) forms the **complementary solution**.
* Any single solution (y_p) to the full nonhomogeneous equation is called a **particular solution**.

---

### 3. General Solution (Theorem 5.3.2)

If (y_1, y_2) form a **fundamental set** of solutions of the complementary equation and (y_p) is any particular solution of the full equation, then:

[
\boxed{y = y_p + c_1y_1 + c_2y_2}
]

is the **general solution** on the interval (I).

---

### 4. Strategy for Solving

1. Solve the **complementary equation** → find (y_1, y_2).
2. **Guess** (or compute) one particular solution (y_p).
3. Combine: (y = y_p + c_1y_1 + c_2y_2.)

---

### 5. Examples

#### Example 5.3.1

Equation:
[
y'' - 2y' + y = e^x.
]

* Complementary: (r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0 \Rightarrow y_c = (c_1 + c_2x)e^x.)
* Guess (y_p = Ae^x). Substitution shows (A=0); refine to (y_p = Ax^2e^x \Rightarrow A=\tfrac12.)
* General: (y = (c_1 + c_2x)e^x + \tfrac12x^2e^x.)

---

#### Example 5.3.2

Equation:
[
y'' + y = x^2.
]

* (r^2 + 1=0 \Rightarrow y_c = c_1\cos x + c_2\sin x.)
* Try (y_p = Ax^2 + Bx + C.)
* Match coefficients ⇒ (A=1, B=0, C=-2.)
* (y_p = x^2 - 2.)
* (y = c_1\cos x + c_2\sin x + x^2 - 2.)

---

#### Example 5.3.3

Equation:
[
y'' + y = \sin x.
]

* (y_c = c_1\cos x + c_2\sin x.)
* Guess (y_p = A x \cos x + B x \sin x.)
* Substitution ⇒ (A=0, B=-\tfrac12.)
* (y_p = -\tfrac12 x \sin x.)
* (y = c_1\cos x + c_2\sin x - \tfrac12 x \sin x.)

---

### 6. Principle of Superposition (Theorem 5.3.3)

If (y_{p1}) solves (L[y]=g_1(x))
and (y_{p2}) solves (L[y]=g_2(x)),
then
[
L[y] = g_1(x) + g_2(x)
]
has a particular solution
[
\boxed{y_p = y_{p1} + y_{p2}}.
]

This extends to any finite linear combination of nonhomogeneous terms.

---

### 7. Practical Comments

* “General solution” means: valid on any interval where coefficients and (a_2(x)) are continuous and (a_2(x)\ne0.)
* If (a_2) has zeros in (I), the solution may not be valid across that point.
* Most examples use **undetermined coefficients** or **variation of parameters** to find (y_p.)

---

**Summary Formula:**
[
\boxed{y = y_p + c_1y_1 + c_2y_2}
]

**Key idea:**
Homogeneous part gives structure; nonhomogeneous part shifts it.
