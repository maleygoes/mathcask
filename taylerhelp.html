## Exercise 2.5 #18

  We are given the following to factor.  There are a few ways to go, but consider this way.
  
$$ 10x^2 - 5x + 10x - 5 $$

I would start by pulling out a common factor of 5 from everything:

  $$ 5(2x^2 - x + 2x -1) $$

  Then see that the inside (just focus on interior here) we can factor by groups:

  $$ 5(x(2x-1) + 1(2x-1)) $$

  Notice how I didn't really factor anything out of the group on the right, I just "factored" a 1 since anything times 1 is itself.

  Then we can see, factoring by groups on the inside, how we'd get 

  $$5((2x-1)(x+1))$
